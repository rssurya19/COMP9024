 for all i=n down to 1 do
      for all j=n down to i do
          print "A[i]A[j]"
      end for
  end for

  for outer loop ( i=n, i>=n, i--);
  for inner loop (j=n, j.=n, j--);

  for each loop the no of iteration are (n-i+1)
  the i decreases to 1 the no of operation also decreases.

  tot operation= summition of i=1 to n-i+1.

  [n(n+1)(2n+1)]/6

  o(n^2).

  for i from 0 to n-1:
        for j from i+1 to n-1:
            if A[i] + A[j] ==v:
            return true
    return false
